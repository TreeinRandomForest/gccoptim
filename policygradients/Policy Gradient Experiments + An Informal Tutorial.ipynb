    "Generally, reinforcement learning problems model a **reward** at every time-step i.e. for each action. This is highly dependent on the problem and often there can be multiple choices.

This is a very crucial point and is what injects the notion of long-term planning into such problems. It is usually easy to do something that maximizes current reward. But that often doesn't lead to long-term reward maximization. For example, capturing pieces greedily in Chess will maximize current reward but you'll most likely lose the game to a well-trained amateur.\n",

A concrete example is that of Atari video-games like Pong.

This process can be repeated as long as we have the table.

    "\n",
    "### Monte-Carlo Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the problem of computing an expected value of some quantity, $X$ following a probability distribution function (p.d.f.) $p(x)$. Mathematically, we want to compute the integral:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx p(x) f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that we don't know $p(x)$! If we did, maybe we could do some kind of discrete approximation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I \\approx \\Sigma_{x_i} p(x_i) f(x_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_i = i * \\delta$ for some fixed lattice spacing $\\delta$ on the one-dimensional real line and $i$ is an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "But an elegant way presents itself. What if we can **sample** various values of X?! If the samples are drawn from the distribution $p(x)$ (the histogram of $n$ samples gets closer to $p(x)$ as $n$ gets larger) and we have a way of drawing more samples when we desire, then we can approximate $I$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{I} \\approx \\Sigma_{x\\sim p} f(x_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be confusing if it's the first time you are seeing this so let's pick an example. Suppose you want to measure the average height of people in a country, C. This would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{h} \\equiv \\mathbb{E}H = \\int_0^{\\infty} dh h p(h)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p(h)dh$ = probability that a person has height between $h$ and $h+dh$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't know $p(h)$ a priori but we just sample i.e. randomly pick $n$ people from the population. As long as the sample is random, the probabilility distribution of our sample will be similar to the actual distribution $p(h)$. BETTER EXPLANATION\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some core questions one would want to answer. (1) What is the error between the Monte-Carlo (MC) estimate, $\\hat{I}$ and the actual value, $I$. We expect this error to vanish (go to 0) as the sample size $n$ increases but how fast does it vanish? (2) What is the variance of $\\hat{I}$? If we picked $k$ different samples of size $n$ each, each sample would have a different estimate $\\hat{I}_k$. Hopefully, on average, these $I_{k}$ will be equal to the true value, $I$ (zero bias) but what about the variance in the values $I_k$? Can we minimize that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte-Carlo Methods are a beautiful and deep topic that have multiple applications. We won't go any deeper here but further study of the topic is highly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, our central object of interest was:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau} R(\\tau) \\nabla\\log P(\\tau; \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can compute this gradient, we can use gradient ascent (not descent) to maximize (not minimize) $J(\\theta)$. Since we wrote it as an expectation, we might be able to use Monte-Carlo sampling which doesn't require the explicit knowledge of the underlying probability distribution to generate $n$ trajectories (also known as **rollouts**) from our policy and then estimate $\\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\theta)$. But we still have a problem. Unlike the simple MC example given above where $f(x_i)$ didn't depend on $p(x)$, here $f(X) = R(\\tau) \\log P(\\tau; \\theta)$ i.e. it depends on $p(x)$. So maybe we are really stuck. We don't know $P(\\tau)$ and need it to estimate the gradient even by MC methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at $\\log P(\\tau)$ in more detail. Recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\tau) = \\underbrace{{\\rho(s_1)}}_{\\text{initial dist.}} \\underbrace{\\pi(a_1|s_1)}_{\\text{policy}}\\underbrace{\\rho(s_2|s_1,a_1)}_{\\text{dynamics}} \\underbrace{\\pi(a_2|s_2)}_{\\text{policy}} \\underbrace{\\rho(s_3|s_2,a_2)}_{\\text{dynamics}}\\ldots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Logs have the nice property of mapping products to sums i.e.: $\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log P(\\tau) = \\log\\rho(s_1)+ \\log \\pi(a_1|s_1) + \\log\\rho(s_2|s_1,a_1) + \\log\\pi(a_2|s_2) + \\log\\rho(s_r|s_2,a_1) + \\ldots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the only terms that depend on $\\theta$ are the ones with the policy, $\\pi$! The derivatives with respect to $\\theta$ for the other terms are 0! So,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla_{\\theta}\\log P(\\tau) = \\nabla_{\\theta}\\log\\rho(s_1)+ \\nabla_{\\theta}\\log \\pi(a_1|s_1) + \\nabla_{\\theta}\\log\\rho(s_2|s_1,a_1) + \\nabla_{\\theta}\\log\\pi(a_2|s_2) + \\nabla_{\\theta}\\log\\rho(s_r|s_2,a_1) + \\ldots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\implies \\nabla_{\\theta}\\log P(\\tau) = \\nabla_{\\theta}\\log \\pi(a_1|s_1) + \\nabla_{\\theta}\\log\\pi(a_2|s_2) + \\ldots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not using $\\Sigma$ explicitly to keep the notation out of the way in case the reader is just getting familiar with it. This is usually written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\implies \\nabla_{\\theta}\\log P(\\tau) = \\Sigma_{i=1}^{T}\\nabla_{\\theta}\\log \\pi(a_i|s_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a key breakthrough. The structure of $P(\\tau)$ depended on the initial distribution of states, $\\rho(s)$ as well as on the dynamics, $\\rho(s_t|s_{t-1},a_{t-1})$ which are both generally unknown. It would be a tall order to find out the exact dynamics of an arbitrary environment. Maybe we could empirically approximate it by doing many experiments. But what we found is that we actually don't need dynamics to compute the gradient needed for gradient ascent. All we need is the policy which is completely under our control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau} R(\\tau) \\nabla \\log P(\\tau; \\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau} R(\\tau) \\left(\\Sigma_{t=1}^{T} \\nabla\\log \\pi(a_t|s_t)\\right) = \\boxed{\\mathbb{E}_{\\tau} \\left(\\Sigma_{t=1}^{T} r_t\\right) \\left(\\Sigma_{t=1}^{T} \\nabla\\log \\pi(a_t|s_t)\\right)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we used $R(\\tau) = r_1 + r_2 + \\ldots + r_T = \\Sigma_{t=1}^T r_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, we can use Monte-Carlo to estimate this expected value. Just like we estimated the average height, $\\mathbb{E}H \\approx \\frac{h_1 + \\ldots + h_n}{n}$ by sampling $n$ random people, we can estimate $\\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau} \\left(\\Sigma_{t=1}^{T} r_t\\right) \\left(\\Sigma_{t=1}^{T} \\nabla\\log \\pi(a_t|s_t)\\right)$ by sampling $n$ random *trajectories* using actions taken from our policy. In other words,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\theta) \\approx \\frac{1}{n}\\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\Sigma_{t=1}^{T} r_t^{(i)}\\right) \\left(\\Sigma_{t=1}^{T} \\nabla\\log \\pi(a_t^{(i)}|s_t^{(i)})\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The index $i$ runs over the $n$ sampled trajectories. There is a superscript on each state and action indicating which trajectory it comes from. If this is too confusing, consider one trajectory. We can start in a start state (either fixed or from a chosen distribution). Our current policy (with parameters $\\theta$) gives us the probability distribution on the possible actions one can take from the current state. We sample one of these actions which \"takes us to a new state\" (more on this in a moment) and gives us an immediate reward, $r_1$. We can again use our policy to sample an action and repeat this process for time-period $T$. This is one sampled trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute the total reward for this trajectory from the $r_t$. Since we know what actions we took and since we know the probabilities of taking those actions from our policy, we can compute $\\log \\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_{t-1})$ and thus the derivatives of this with respect to $\\theta$: $\\nabla_{\\theta}\\log \\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_{t-1})$. Repeating this for each time-step gives us the quantity: $\\left(\\Sigma_{t=1}^T r_t\\right)\\left(\\Sigma_{t=1}^T \\nabla_{\\theta}\\log\\pi(a_t|s_t)\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this for $n$ trajectories, average these products of sums, and get an estimate of $\\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\theta)$. This would be used to update our policy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_{t} + \\eta \\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta_{1}$ is the set of parameters for the initial policy, which is updated through time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we mentioned that taking an action \"takes us to a new state\". Recall that the new state depends on the dynamics, $\\rho(s_t|s_{t-1},a_{t-1})$ which we usually don't know! So how do we know which state to go to? We usually do these experiments either in real-life or a simulator. In real-life, the dynamics are of course, \"built in\". An accurate simulator will mimic real-life closely but with the advantage that one has the ability to morph and change the environment as well as look at information not available to the policy but that might help understand the agent's behavior.\n"

    "\n",
    "Let's summarize what we have learned till this point. For multi-class classification, we define the loss for an example to be the (negative) log of the probability that the model predicted for the correct label. There is a clear notion of what the correct label is. Maximizing this probability of predicting the label would lead to a lower loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "For policy gradients, we can treat each action in each trajectory as an independent data point. **We don't know what action is the \"correct\" action to take at any point in time.** So we declare that the action we took is the correct one! Mechanically this means that we now care about the (negative) log of the predicted probability of taking the action we actually performed. In the case of multiclass classification, we wanted to increase this probability by tuning the model's parameters. In the policy gradient case, we still aim to increase this probability but we weigh each log probability contribution by the total reward received for the trajectory that it was a part of. So increasing the probability of taking an action given a state by a fixed amount $\\epsilon$ will count for far more if the action was taken in a high-reward trajectory than if it was taken for a low reward trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, this equivalence between multi-class supervised learning and policy gradients has some convenient side-effects. We can simulate or run $n$ trajectories using our current policy (with possibly very sub-optimal parameters, $\\theta$), collect the list of probabilities, $\\pi(a_t|s_t)$, weight each one by the total reward of the trajectory (gotten after the end of the trajectory) and then define a loss that looks very similar to multi-class cross-entropy except that each $\\pi(a_t|s_t)$ term has a weight equal to the total reward in its trajectory. At this stage, we can use all the power of our auto-diff library to pretend we have a classification problem and optimize $J(\\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighing by $R(\\tau)$ is also intuitively satisfying: we should maximize the probability of actions taken during high-reward trajectories and minimize the probability of actions taken during low-reward trajectories.\n",
    "\n",

Each trajectory has T time-steps. For each trajectory, at each time-step, the probability for taking the action that was taken is recorded. The total reward for each trajectory is also rewarded. Given these two quantities, we compute the total $\"J\" = \\frac{1}{n}\\Sigma_{i}=1^{n} \\left(\\Sigma_{t=1}^T \\log \\pi(a_t^{(i)}|s_t^{(i)}) \\right)\\left(R(\\tau^{(i)})\\right)$ and then do back-propagation to calculate the gradients. These gradients are used to update the policy weights to **increase** $\"J\"$ (gradient ascent instead of descent).\n",

The reward rapidly increases (becomes less negative) and ideally we would get 0 empirical reward i.e. at each time-step, the action picked was exactly equal to the state for our environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each iteration, we generate batch_size trajectories. Not only that, we never use the trajectories generated in previous iterations for the current iteration. In other words, we throw away all the data (which is generated sequentially on a CPU not the GPU). This is very different from supervised learning where we have a static dataset that stays constant. Is this justified? Can't we just keep a growing data-structure that has all the data generated till time t? The answer is no! Recall that when training supervised models, we make the assumption that the distribution that the training data is generated from is the same as the one the test data or new data that will be encountered is generated from. In the RL case, each time the policy changes, the distribution of actions taken and states visited is changed which means the training data at the current iteration is drawn from a different distribution from the training data in past iterations and they can be bundled together. This leads to the question of whether we can do some modifications or corrections to data from past iterations and will lead us to the notion of **importance sampling** (but later). \n",

To be more precise, the policy predicts a probability distribution over all possible actions for a given state. Below, for each state, we plot the action with the **highest** probability."

    "We do see a strong correlation between the state and action which is great news! In the ideal case, the policy would realize that choosing the action to be equal to the state maximizes the reward. It comes close but has a hard-time \"resolving the reward structure at a finer level\". For example, the policy always picks the action 2 when the state varies from -1 to +4. It realizes that beyond this state, the action must be increased but can't figure out these it can increase the expected reward by choosing different actions within this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can already anticipate a potential problem. Suppose, our initial policy is very confident but wrong (unfortunately, a widespread phenomenon among humans today) about the actions it must take in every state. Then, as we generate different trajectories, we will never find out, for example, that taking the confident action +4 in state 0 is far worse than the action +1 in state 0. Since we will never try out action +1 in state 0, we will never learn and improve on what we know. This is the problem of **exploration** i.e. taking a risk and trying something different from what you (the policy) knows in the hope of finding a better action or outcome.\n",
